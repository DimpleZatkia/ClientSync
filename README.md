# ClientSync

Problem: It is difficult to filter out clients based on the cases they bring to the law firm and on their history, decreasing workplace productivity
Solution: I proposed a solution to filter clients based on certain clients’ features and parameters and a system which could decide whether the client’s case is to be accepted or not based on those features and parameters. The gap that is being bridged here is assessing the expectations of client and evaluating if this can be something which the legal team shares a possible expectation, hence enhancing workplace productivity, saving money and time, bringing the law firm at a larger platform.

Our Legal consulting process required 15 tables to capture the process in a complete fashion. The
key was in quantifying the significance of every metric, maintaining database consistency and
understanding entity dependencies. The process was drafted from end to end by linking the
Survey (Client Behavior), Profitability metric, Client background and judge analytics into the
decision model.
